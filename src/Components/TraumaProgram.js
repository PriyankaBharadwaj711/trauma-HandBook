            The CHKD trauma program serves the children of Hampton Roads, Virginia's Eastern Shore and Northeastern North Carolina. As a specialized pediatric medical center, CHKD provides a multi- disciplinary approach to care for injured children for all ranges of acuity and injuries. The commitment to provide care to traumatically injured children and their families extends from the frontline providers to the board of directors. CHKD is currently seeking trauma center verification from the Virginia Department of Health which will allow for pediatric specialists from ED, surgery, ICU and all subspecialties to care for patients directly from the field. The trauma service is staffed by board-certified pediatric surgeons and their support team of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, residents, interns and office staff.

            The trauma program is led by a board-certified pediatric surgeon who completed a fellowship in trauma. The program is co-managed by a pediatric emergency physician and employs a full-time RN trauma program manager, RN trauma registrar and RN clinical practice educator specialist.

            The program director chairs the hospital multi-disciplinary trauma PI committee which includes representatives from all the major surgical specialties and services including administration and nursing. The trauma PI committee provides oversight for systems, patient care, quality, policies and procedures to ensure the optimum care of any injured patient is achieved.

            Trauma is a surgical disease that requires the need for multiple specialty services which CHKD is uniquely qualified to provide. The purpose of this manual is to document established guidelines that ensure an organized and systematic approach to care.
